# PuTTY Themer

This simple Ruby script applies a defined colour scheme to every PuTTY session
you have saved in your registry.

For obvious reasons, this only works under Windows.

By default, the colour scheme is [Solarized Dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), using the [Fira Mono OT font](http://www.carrois.com/fira-3-1/). I haven't
yet taken the time to make it easier to adjust these, but feel free to fork off
and do it yourself - all pull requests are welcome!

Have fun!
