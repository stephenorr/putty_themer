# PuTTy Themer

This simple Ruby script takes a defined colour scheme (by default, Solarized Dark) and
applies it to all PuTTy session profiles you have stored in your registry.

## Compatibility

- PuTTy only runs on Windows, so the same is true of this script.
- Tested with a range of Ruby versions, but assume 2.1 and up.
